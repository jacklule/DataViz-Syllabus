### Principles: Before Class
- Politico: [How Comic Journalism Grew Up](http://www.politico.eu/article/how-comic-journalism-grew-up/)
- Journalism.co.uk, ["Is Comic Journalism Making a Combeback?"](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/is-comics-journalism-making-a-comeback-/s2/a566260/)
- Comics are useful for subjects difficult to report, such as subjects covered by [the work of Molly Crabapple](https://www.vice.com/author/Molly-Crabapple).
- Also important is the [the work of Dan Nott](https://medium.com/@dan_nott/what-is-mass-incarceration-ff737196580#.h48rmo8nr), six minute read of text and cartoon.

### Practice: In-Class Exercise

View sample of comic journalism:
- [Kidnapped in Syria](http://narrative.ly/meet-the-press/kidnapped-in-syria/)
- [Rolling Blackout](http://www.newsweek.com/2016/10/07/rolling-blackouts-and-doomed-state-foreign-reporting-502333.html)
- Comic Journalism: [Chasing Paper with Yanukovychleaks](http://niemanreports.org/articles/chasing-paper-with-yanukovychleaks/)
- [Review of The Arab of the Future](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/10/27/riad-sattouf-growing-up-arab/), a graphic memoir

Over the past five years, I have created online comics for a variety of uses: grant proposals, online classes, conference presentations and more. They are excellent communication devices.

Online comic creation, however, must be a bad business model. A number of the creation sites I have used in the past -- Xtranormal, Bitstrips, Powtoon, GoAnimate -- have either gone under or raised prices so high that they are of little value to educators.

Pixton is my latest creator site. No matter what site you use, recognize that comics can be an exellent to communicate and to stand out in the visualization field.

Go to [Pixton](https://www.pixton.com/) and sign up for an individual account ("For Fun"). Create your primary character. Take your time, this character will represent you in an introduction to your data visualizations. You surely should do better than my Pixton introduction:

### The Sad Rise and Fall of Bitstrips
- Bitstrips became popular, perhaps too popular, as a [Facebook feature](https://www.facebook.com/games/bitstrips/).
- [Chronicle of Higher Education: Make Your Own Comic Using Bitstrips](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/make-your-own-comic-strip-using-bitstrips-for-projects-or-assignments/51571)
- Bitstrips morphed into Bitmoji. [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2016/01/bitmoji_the_silly_cartoon_avatars_that_say_everything_you_can_t.html) and [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/fashion/my-bitmoji-my-better-self.html?_r=0) on the use of Bitmoji.
- 2016: Bitstrips and Bitmoji are [bought by Snapchat](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2016/03/25/snapchat-buys-bitstrips-for-100-million/?utm_source=socialtimes&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=dailynewsletter20160325) and then Bitstrips was mysteriously closed in September 2016.
- But Bitstrips and its its principles can be used and embedded for use on personal, educational and journalistic pages. Comics make your work stand out.
- The journal, SANE, Sequential Art Narrative in Education, published a [review of five cartoon-making applications](http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&context=sane):	ToonDoo,	Comic	Life,	Scholastic’s	Graphix	Comic	Builder, CreazaCartoonist, and	finally,	Microsoft	Word.
