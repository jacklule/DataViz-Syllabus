# Day 10

## Telling Stories that Engage Readers

We will continue learning the principles and practice of interactivity in data visualizations.

## Principles: Before Class

- View videos 9-15 in [Getting Started with Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources). Total time: 28:30 minutes.
- [The work of Ben Jones at Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/about/blog/contributors/ben-jones)
- Designing for Interactivity: [On the challenges of interative AND mobile](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/how-the-wall-street-journal-approaches-data-interactives-on-mobile/s2/a574385/) by Elliot Bentley, of the Wall Street Journal

## Principles: In Class
- Quiz on Days 9 and 10

## Practice: In Class

- Download (or perhaps connect directly to Google Sheets from Tableau), this [data set on Ethnicity at Lehigh](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12NuHCygG7XaS4Nd0GHgStiEWUjXYpYXuC2Ru2ntLnWw/edit?usp=sharing)
- Follow our class [Tableau instructions](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/Tableau.md) and create an interactive time-series chart tracking the data
- publish to your github.io page

## Practice: Out of Class
## Graded Assignment
- Find a dataset that you are interested in. You will find links to many datasets at the [Finding Data](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/Finding%20Data.md) page of this DataViz Syllabus.
- Create an interactive visualization (chart or map) at Tableau. The visualization should have at least one sheet on a dashboard with title and your name.
- Strive for best data viz principles from our [data viz checklist](http://stephanieevergreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DataVizChecklist_May2014.pdf).
- Publish to your github.io page and send me the link.
