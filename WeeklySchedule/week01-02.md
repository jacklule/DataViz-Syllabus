##Principles: In Class
- 5-question quiz for Day One, see [Concept Table]
- Review syllabus
- Discuss assignments: famous visualizations and videos
- Review Preattentive attributes: [Checklist](http://mediashift.org/2016/02/checklist-does-your-data-visualization-say-what-you-think-it-says/?utm_source=MediaShift+Daily&utm_campaign=59b3a6caad-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_70e55682fc-59b3a6caad-299977941), MediaShift essay by the editorial manager of Tableau
- Review [Data Visualization Checklist](http://stephanieevergreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DataVizChecklist_May2014.pdf), by Stephanie Evergreen and Ann Emery. We will agree on the main categories by which to judge our work. 
- Review our class [evaluation rubric]

##Practice 
- Create a GitHub portfolio site with HTML5 at github.io
- [Setting up GitHub hosting pages, github.io](https://pages.github.com/). But first see annotations at [class GitHub Setup Guide](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md), for setup without GitHub Desktop
- Remembering that the page eventually will be their GitHub portfolio, students should customize their pages. Directions To Customize the GitHub.io Page can be found at our [class GitHub Setup Guide](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md). For example, [my GitHub Page](http://jacklule.github.io/)
- Also see, [Creating an HTML page](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)

###Flowing Data
- [FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/) is a great website and resource written by Nathan Yau, who also has some key books on working with data.
