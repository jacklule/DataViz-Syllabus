### What we'll cover

- Common geodata formats: Shapefiles, KML, and GeoJSON.
- Mapping with Fusion Tables.
- Mapping with JavaScript.

### Post-class assignments

- If the data for your long-term project has a geographic component, map it with either Fusion Tables or JavaScript. If not, do the same for either the FEC data from Week 5 or the Facebook data from Week 8. Is this data better presented as a map, or some other sort of visualization? Explain why.
